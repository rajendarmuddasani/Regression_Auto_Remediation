```

#### 🔧 Files Created (Session 1)
```
✅ main.py                      # Main application entry point
✅ server.py                    # FastAPI server launcher  
✅ test_env.py                  # Environment testing script

```

#### 🔐 Security Measures Implemented
**Database Configuration Approach:**
```bash
# Environment file structure (../.env)
DBDRIVER=Oracle
DBUSER=<USERNAME>
DBPASSWD=<PASSWORD>
DBHOST=<HOSTNAME>
PORT=<PORT>
DBNAME=<DATABASE_NAME>
```

**Code Security Patterns:**
- All database credentials use environment variables
- No hardcoded sensitive information in any files
- Generic table names in documentation
- Placeholder approach for configuration examples

#### 📋 Issues Encountered & Resolved

**Issue #1: Dual Model Directory Structure Confusion**
- **Problem**: Unclear whether to use `src/models/` vs `models/` directory
- **Root Cause**: Ambiguity in folder structure for ML models vs source code
- **Solution**: Decided on single `models/` directory with logical subfolders:
  ```
  models/
  ├── src/            # Model classes and training code
  ├── trained/        # Serialized model files  
  └── training_data/  # Training datasets
  ```
- **Command Applied**: Updated all documentation to reflect this structure

**Issue #2: Database Security in GitHub**
- **Problem**: Concern about exposing database credentials in public repository
- **Root Cause**: Initial documentation had placeholder credentials that looked real
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive placeholder system
- **Commands Applied**:
  ```bash
  # Updated PRD.md with secure placeholders
  # Changed all specific references to generic ones
  # Implemented ../.env configuration pattern
  ```

**Issue #3: Presentation Naming Convention**
- **Problem**: "MANAGER_PRESENTATION" name too specific for general use
- **Root Cause**: Naming limited presentation flexibility for different audiences
- **Solution**: Renamed to generic "PRESENTATION" files
- **Commands Applied**:
  ```bash
  mv MANAGER_PRESENTATION.html PRESENTATION.html
  mv MANAGER_PRESENTATION.md PRESENTATION.md
  # Updated internal titles and references
  ```
