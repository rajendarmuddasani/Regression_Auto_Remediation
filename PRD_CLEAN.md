# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for V93K Regression Auto-Remediation System

## Goal

Develop an intelligent auto-remediation system that analyzes V93K SMT7/8 test program regression results, automatically identifies issues (test failures, runtime errors, pattern mismatches, duplicate test numbers, build errors), and provides automated solutions or fixes.
