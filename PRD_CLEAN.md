# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for V93K Regression Auto-Remediation System

## Goal

Develop an intelligent auto-remediation system that analyzes V93K SMT7/8 test program regression results, automatically identifies issues, and provides automated solutions or fixes. The system addresses predictable patterns including known fails, integration issues, missing patterns, build errors, runtime errors and exceptions, double test numbers, missing test numbers, git cloning issues, space issues, machine down issues, API down issues, and configuration issues. The system will continuously learn from every regression cycle to improve its diagnostic and remediation capabilities over time, reducing manual effort by 70-80% and enabling engineers to focus on complex, value-added tasks.
