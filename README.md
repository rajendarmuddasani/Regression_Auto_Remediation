# V93K Regression Auto-Remediation System

## Background

In semiconductor test engineering, V93K SMT7/8 test programs with latest modular baselines undergo frequent validations under regression to ensure functionality and catch issues early in the development cycle. However, regression failures often follow predictable patterns - known fails, integration issues, missing patterns, build errors, runtime errors and exceptions, double test numbers, missing test numbers, git cloning issues, space issues, machine down issues, API down issues, and configuration issues. Currently, engineers spend significant time manually diagnosing and fixing these recurring issues, leading to delayed releases and reduced productivity. The V93K Regression Auto-Remediation System addresses this challenge by automatically analyzing regression results, identifying issues, and applying proven solutions with minimal human intervention.
